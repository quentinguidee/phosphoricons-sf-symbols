# PhosphorIcons SF Symbols

This project is an unofficial port of PhosphorIcons for Swift. This package is an implementation of the SF Symbols for PhosphorIcons. If you prefer to use normal assets or if you don't need SF Symbols, use the [official library](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/swift).

Notes:

- Due to some limitations, width variants are not implemented. Only the regular width is present.
- Color variants are coming progressively. Feel free to contribute if needed.
